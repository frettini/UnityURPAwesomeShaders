This repo is a container for various Unity shaders and rendering techniques I encounter and want to implement. This is using Unity 2022.3.8.
Here are some noteworthy shaders I have implemented so far:

* shell effect : usually used as a way to render fur, I implemented a shell effect that could be used for grass and hologram effects.
  Tried to use the geometry stage and quickly ran into problems with transparency...
* Linked List Transparency : this is pretty much a repeat of this repo: https://github.com/happy-turtle/oit-unity , that I tried to follow along and learn on the way.
* Stochastic Transparency: See this repo for more info: https://github.com/frettini/StochasticTransparency
  
This is completely experimental, by no means ready for production but I'll be glad if it is of any use to anyone :)
